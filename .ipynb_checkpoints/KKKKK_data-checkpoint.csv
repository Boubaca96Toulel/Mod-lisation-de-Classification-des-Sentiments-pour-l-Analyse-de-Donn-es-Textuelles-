it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy  	0
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after  	0
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles  	1
his performance is simply genius  	1
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire  ",1,"['youll', 'love', 'movie', 'bad', 'bad', 'film', 'way', 'long', 'definitely', 'one', 'bad', 'ones', 'movie', 'received', 'great', 'quality', 'film', 'age', 'john', 'wayne', 'incredible', 'job', 'young', 'movie', 'industry', 'screen', 'presence', 'shined', 'thought', 'even', 'though', 'senior', 'actors', 'screen', 'think', 'must', 'see', 'older', 'john', 'wayne', 'film', 'really', 'dont', 'see', 'anyone', 'could', 'enjoy', 'movie', 'dont', 'think', 'ive', 'ever', 'seen', 'movie', 'half', 'boring', 'selfindulgent', 'piece', 'junk', 'probably', 'would', 'better', 'director', 'hadnt', 'spent', 'movie', 'showcasing', 'art', 'work', 'really', 'isnt', 'noteworthy', 'another', 'thing', 'didnt', 'really', 'like', 'character', 'got', 'punched', 'face', 'gallon', 'blood', 'would', 'spew', 'forth', 'soon', 'jamie', 'foxx', 'absolutely', 'ray', 'charles', 'performance', 'simply', 'genius', 'owns', 'film', 'spacek', 'owned', 'coal', 'miners', 'daughter', 'quaid', 'owned', 'great', 'balls', 'fire']"
" in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself  	1
ray charles is legendary  	1
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician  	1
hitchcock is a great director  	1
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch  	0
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie  	1
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films  	0
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy  	0
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes  	0
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws  	0
mishima is extremely uninteresting  	0
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture  	0
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy  	0
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc  	0
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else  	0
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films  	0
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it  	1
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything  	1
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was  how it contained holes inconsistencies and  frankly  a whole lot of crap  and how horrid the dancing was  	0
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic  	0
the character developments also lacked in depth  	0
woa talk about awful  	0
do not waste your time  	0
it was just too horrible  	0
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on  	0
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction  	0
the poor actors  	0
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action  	0
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance  	0
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick  	0
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made  	1
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care  	1
regrettably the film fails  	0
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative  	0
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie  	0
yet i enjoy watching it  	1
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad  	0
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad  	0
the dialogue sucked  	0
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked  	0
the soundtrack sucked  	0
the acting sucked  	0
the concert sequences just sucked  	0
that was nice  	1
that was funny  	1
it was so funny  	1
overall this movie was cheap trash  	0
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it  	0
i came out of it feeling angry  	0
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted  	1
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart  	1
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans  	1
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here  	1
all things considered a job very well done  	1
thanks good a movie like this was done and released  	1
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it  	1
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura  	1
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous  	1
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film  	1
up there with the best of melville  	1
everything about this film is simply incredible  	1
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child  	1
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience  	1
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous  	1
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series  	1
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film  	0
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded  	0
there is a lot of beautiful places  	1
it was forced like everything in this movie  	0
again lame  	0
heres where the movie really pied me off  	0
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork  	0
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick  	0
summary the witticisms werent witty  	0
the plot  well i said id let that one go  	0
the acting was bad  	0
really bad  	0
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse  	0
camerawork  again bad  	0
rating 1 out of 10  	0
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time  	1
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me  	1
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema  	1
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art  	1
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen  	1
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome  	1
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years  	1
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy  	1
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art  	1
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy  	1
i literally vomited while watching this film  	0
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls  	1
his performance as awarded was stunning  	1
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop  	1
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast  	1
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast  	1
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence  	0
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some

" with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough  	1
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever  	1
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle  	1
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking  	0
lots of holes in the script  	0
its like a bad two hour tv movie  	0
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong  	0
the dialogue is atrocious  	0
the acting is beyond abysmal  	0
everything stinks  	0
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on  	0
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings  	0
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time  	0
in short dont bother with this movie  	0
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing  	1
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it  	1
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it  	1
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame  	1
a film not easily forgotten  	1
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor  	1
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years  	1
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable  	1
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular  	1
great movie  	1
also the story and acting were weak  	0
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt  	0
either way it sucks  	0
the script is horrendously stupid  	0
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest  	0
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid  	0
what the hell kind of crap is that  	0
then theres the plot holes  	0
you could drive a semi truck into these holes  	0
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film  	1
shes poised and amazing  	1
dee snider just plain sucks  	0
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep  	0
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing  	0
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks  	0
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably  	0
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life  	0
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid  	0
avoid at any and all costs  	0
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies  	0
avoid this film at all costs  	0
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess  	0
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict  	0
now this is a movie i really dislike  	0
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere  	0
the puppets look really cheesy  not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks  	0
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets  	0
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible  	0
